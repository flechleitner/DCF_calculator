#### DCF calculator 

This is an R script that allows calculation of the 14C dead carbon fraction (DCF) or reservoir effect 
in stalagmites.

Please acknowledge Franziska Lechleitner (University of Bern) and Jens Fohlmeister (PIK Potsdam) 
as the authors of the code when using it. 

Formatting of input stalagmite data tipps:
- UTh age of stalagmite in years BP (with BP referring to 1950 CE)
- UTh age error needs to be 2 sigma
